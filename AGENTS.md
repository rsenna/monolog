# AGENTS.md

## Repository

This repository is **monolog**, a C++ Logo interpreter with Allegro turtle graphics. The repository slug is the canonical project name in documentation and release metadata.

## Working rules

- Read `README.md` and `SPEC.md` before changing behavior.
- Keep changes focused; do not bundle unrelated cleanup with a feature or fix.
- Do not commit secrets, generated dependency directories, build outputs, editor state, or local absolute paths.
- Preserve existing licenses and attribution.
- Update `README.md` and `SPEC.md` when user-visible behavior, support status, setup, or architecture changes.
- Prefer the smallest supported dependency upgrade. Major upgrades must include migration notes and validation.

## Setup

Install a C++17 compiler, Make, and Allegro 5.

## Validation

Run the applicable commands before opening a pull request:

- `make -C lang token_test tokenizer_test arg_test args_test ast_node_test`
- Run the generated `lang/*_test.out` binaries.
- `make -C main main`

If a tool or platform is unavailable, record exactly what was not run and why.

## Project-specific guidance

Keep parsing/evaluation independent from Allegro where possible. Run non-graphics tests first. Do not remove platform linker flags without replacing them with detected configuration.

## Pull requests

Explain the problem, the chosen approach, user/developer impact, tests run, and remaining limitations. Keep commits reviewable and never report a check as passing unless it was executed.
